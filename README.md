# CMM3Project - Group 16

#### Introduce

This is a project storage for 2021 Year3 Computational Method and Modeling 3 Group 16 Work in the University of Edinburgh.

To know more about this project, you can watch [lecture7.pdf][1] slide.

The [main.py][2] is our main code. The file contains reference demos written by the team members and other groups.

Be warn! The deadline of this project is **28th Nov**.

#### Goals of the Project

- Design and implement a simulation code, based on a Lagrangian particle-based method, for the advection and diffusion of a substance
- Use the developed code to perform simulations to address engineering questions

---

#### Tasks

**Tasks A. Develop a python code with some functionality.**
  
In Task A, we will need to generate an invitational code to solve the advetion diffusion problem in a 2D and 1D problem.

After initializing the conditions, we firstly generate the position of the particles position, then use Euler method and Gaussian random numbers to calculate the position of each particle after a step time, and display it with a grid graph. Next step, repeat the position after the next step time Calculate until touch the maximum time.

**Tasks B. Validation**

**Tasks C. Develop a user interface**
  
In Task C, we create a GUI window by using tkinter lib. We create 16 interface including max time, step time, domain range, diffusivity, number of grids, number of particles, velocity type, initial condition, radius and Center of circle of blue area and plot type.

**Tasks D. Use the python code you developed to perform the following engineering simulations**
